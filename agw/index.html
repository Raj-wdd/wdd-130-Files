            Global warming is one of the most serious challenges facing humanity today. It refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. This warming leads to a range of environmental issues, including melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. It is critical to raise awareness and take action to combat this global crisis.
